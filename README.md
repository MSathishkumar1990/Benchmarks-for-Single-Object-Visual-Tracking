## Evaluation Methodology: Precision, Accuracy, Robustness

### P -- Precision  

Calculating center position error by euclidean distance between result center and annotation center.

### IoU->AOS+AUC: Intersection over Union -- Accuracy

$$
S=|intersection(r_t,r_0)|/|union(r_t,r_0)|
$$

S denotes Average Overlap Score.

Corresponding to the sampled overlap threshold, Area Under Curve can be generated by average(S).

### OPE+TRE+SRE -- Robustness

The basic factor to evaluate robustness of a tracker is the number of times the tracker failed.

One Pass Evaluation:  Test each tracker on each sequence once.

Spatial Robustness Evaluation: Adding 8 spatial shifts(4 center shifts, 4 corner shifts) and 4 scale variations to bounding boxes in 10% frames of entire sequence. Test each tracker on each sequence for 12 times.

Temporal Robustness Evaluation: Tracker running starts from different frames. Test each tracker on each sequence for 20 times.

### OPER+SRER -- Accuracy+Stability+Robustness

One Pass Evaluation with Restart: use ground truth to restart a tracker after its failure.

Spatial Robustness Evaluation with Restart: add spatial perturbation(noise).

### Reinitialization (VOT)

The idea is developed from OPE. If the tracker loses tracking for continuous 5 frames, it is restarted with ground truth. To reduce the bias after ground truth, the first 10 frames ,i.e. Burnin, is excluded from performance evaluation.

### Average per Frame (VOT): per-frame Accuracy+Robustness

$$
P_A=(1/N)sigma_1^N(accuracy(tracker_i,frame_t))
$$

$$
P_R=(1/N)sigma_1^N(robustness(tracker_i,frame_t))
$$

### Challenges

Challenging tasks in tracking:

Camera Motion: Abrupt motion of the camera; (CM)

In-Plane Rotation: The target rotates in the image plane; (IPR) 

Out-of-Plane Rotation: The target rotates out of the image plane; (OPR) 

Deformation: Non-rigid object deformation; (DEF) 

Fully Occluded: The target is fully occluded; (FOC) 

Partially Occluded: The target is partially occluded; (POC) 

Illumination Variation: The illumination of the target changes significantly; (IV) 

Out of View: Some portion of the target leaves the camera field of view; (OV)

Viewpoint Change: Viewpoint affects target appearance significantly. (VC)

Scale Variation: The ratio of bounding box area is outside the range [0.5, 2] after 1s; (SV) 

Motion Blur: The target region is blurred due to the motion of target or camera; (MB)

Aspect Ratio Change: The ratio of bounding box aspect ration is outside the range [0.5, 2] after 1s; (ARC)

Low Resolution: At least one ground truth bounding box has less than 1000 pixels; (LR)

Fast Motion: The motion of the bounding box is larger than the size of the bounding box; (FM) 

Background Clutter: The background near the target has similar appearance as the target; (BC) 

Similar Object: There are objects of similar shape or same type near the target.
